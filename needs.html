						<h2>Drink Clean Water</h2>
						<p>Staying hydrated is essential while camping, hiking or just spending time outside. Here's how to find the best water sources, then ensure their water is safe to drink. You can survive for weeks without food, but only a day or two without water. It also helps regulate body temperature, making it the second most important factor in the list of survival priorities: shelter, water, fire, food and enhances your physical performance while warding off both hypo and hyperthermia. In less extreme scenarios (i.e 99.9999% of the time), water is a non-compressible substance that, at 8.34lbs-per-gallon, is heavy and you'll need to be drinking at least a gallon of it a day when you're outside. You can't physically carry enough water to see you through a multi-day trip, so you'll need to find it along the way.

						<h2>Having Fire</h2>
						<p>In many survival situations, the ability to start a fire in the wilderness can make the difference between living and dying. Fire can fulfill many needs. It can provide warmth and comfort. It not only cooks and preserves food, it also provides warmth in the form of heated food that saves calories our body normally uses to produce body heat. You can use fire to purify water, sterilize bandages, signal for rescue, and provide protection from animals. It can be a psychological boost by providing peace of mind and companionship. You can also use fire to produce tools and weapons. Fire can cause problems, as well. It can cause forest fires or destroy essential equipment. Fire can also cause burns, or carbon monoxide poisoning when used in shelters.

						<h2>Food to Eat</h2>
						<p>Why humans need food to survive? The first reason why humans need food is because animals and human get energy from the food they eat and it also provides us with nutrients and to make us be healthy and active. Food also provides us for Development and growth. What if we didn't have food? If we didn't have food, the muscle in a human body would not work or function because no energy would be coming in the body. For example, the diaphragm needs energy because it is a muscle and without the energy from the food the muscle will not react which means it will prevent oxygen from coming into the body causing death. Why do humans need oxygen to survive? Humans need oxygen because when you inhale, the oxygen in the air is absorbed into your bloodstream through tiny sacs in your lungs.

						<h2>Having a Shelter</h2>
						<p>Understanding how to create effective wilderness survival shelters is one of the most important outdoor skills. From keeping you protected from the elements to providing a place to rest, wilderness shelters serve a key role in survival situations. Not only do they provide for physical needs, but also help create a sense of home in the wilderness. Though each season and environment presents its own challenges, there are several universal principles for creating effective wilderness survival shelters.
